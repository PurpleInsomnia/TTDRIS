(HIGHLIGHTS FROM "THE SILENT"'s trial)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[TRAUVIAN REP]:
When did you join Proof Makers?


[The Silent]:
Um...4232/359th...


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
And how old were you when you joined?


[The Silent]:
F-fifteen years old...


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
Why did you join Proof Makers?


[The Silent]:
My...m-m-mom tried to kill me because her mental illness made her think that
Deprai was sending her a message to kill me.


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
And you believed that it was mental illness...and not that some miracle happened?
If Deprai asked me to kill my child, I would do it.


[The Silent]:
I-I don't know...yes...?


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
What happened when your mother tried to kill you?


[The Silent]:
I-I...called the Enforcement Patrol, told them that she was trying to kill me, they took her away.
That night those fuckers dropped her off after she told them that it was Deprai who was talking to her...


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
And this, changed how your percieved him, the creator of everything?


[The Silent]:
...Yes. I...HATED anyone who associated with something that probably isn't even real.


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
Well that's the problem, [REDACTED], he is.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[TRAUVIAN REP]:
How did you meet [The Traitor]?


[The Silent]:
A...a recruitment process. A random team member would be handing out flyers to miserable looking people to a shrine that
didn't even exist. Advertised it as "Only join if you're having trouble connecting with him", the people who'd look in hatred
were greeted with the recruiter's expression turning from cheerful to deadpan. And would whisper "I hate him too" in your ear as they hand you
the flyer, and would tell you to meet the group there.


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
Have you participated in recruitment?


[The Silent]:
...n-no I'm not good at reading social cues....


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
Have any of the team members misjudged while recruiting? If so, what would they do?


[The Silent]:
They'd pass it off as a dark joke. If it doesn't work, they'd signal another person to follow them, and kill them when they were away from
prying eyes.


[TRAUVIAN REP]:
Have you participated in the assasinations?


[The Silent]:
Y-yes...

Seax:
We the federal justice system, the Trauvian Government and representing Trauvia and all it's ancestors before today,
give me the honor, as leader of our immaculate empire, to scentence the defendant, Lucy Kelpza, to life in service in the Trauvian Military.
And give her the historic, unhonorable title of "The Silent".


Lucy Kelpza (The Silent):
(She exhales in relief)


Seax: 
...The reason for the title;
(He breathes slowly before an evil grin forms on his face)
...will be the public removal of the defendant, Lucy Kelpza's vocal chords.
Immediately after the trial, the entire capital city, and Trauvians from across the world watching on a madatory brodcast,
will be subject in the viewing of the bloody, barbaric removal of Lucy Kelpza's vocal chords. May Deprai bless you the ability to use your voice
for a final time. Thank you.

(The auido is uncomfortable to listen to, but the sound of applauding and cheering is mixed with the defendant's screaming and pleads as she's taken away by guards.)

(Editors note: Did we censor The Silent's real name? I don't know, she deserved it but I can't stand hearing that cry for help again...)
