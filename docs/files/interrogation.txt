[Interrogator]:
Do you know why we're here in this room today? 


[THE MONSTER]:
They want to hide the truth. 


[Interrogator]:
We are not discussing what you think seems to be the truth, we need to know why you decided to do so much for no reason. 


[THE MONSTER]:
The Uprising Of Galaxy 5? They seem to be twisting my involvement in the plans to suit their own justification of treating me like the most dangerous being in the universe.


[Interrogator]:
We're talking about what you were doing after you escaped. 


[THE MONSTER]:
(they chuckle mockingly) I'll tell you all about it... 


[Interrogator]:
Before escaping your cell, you briefly told Seax that you wanted to have a shrine to contact Deprai.
Excited that you might've finally changed your ways, you were given the shrine. 
To which you told Deprai, sarcastically, that you identify as your own race, separate from us. Tell me, what was the purpose of this?


[THE MONSTER]:
If what you claim to be real, is real; then I would have become THE one to survive The Wipeout.
When the time comes when you're proven wrong however, I will laugh in the irony and I will become your new God. 


[Interrogator]:
New God? What point are you trying to fucking get at? 


[THE MONSTER]:
...I've seen so much on my journey through the universe...I know of a secret power that could grant me the ability to become a living, breathing, physical, God. 


[Interrogator]:
Give us info on this so called secret power. 


[THE MONSTER]:
And risk it getting into the hands of Seax?
Not a chance. It's not even on this plane of existence you naive simpeltons...


[Interrogator]:
I'm not asking, Monster. 


[THE MONSTER]:
You think I'm scared of you? You puppet? Deaf, blind, dumb. Only existing to follow.
Seax wasn't brave enough to face me himself. 


[Interrogator]:
What are you talking about..are you even sound of mind? 

[THE MONSTER]:
They're brain washing you...unlock the cell. Together, we can bring them down. 


[Interrogator]:
Even the clowns behind the Uprising Of Galaxy 5 couldn't take down us.
Nice try, fucker.


[THE MONSTER]:
(they cackle loudly) I was the only competent one...


[Interrogator]:
What about the founder, The Traitor? 


[THE MONSTER]:
He got us caught, he should have scattered out those goddamn resting points after I bombed The Bulb.
Fucker decided for us to all meet...it's his own fault. I tried to warm him about it...That idiot was
too caught up with winning to even think about what can go wrong...what a shame too...


[Interrogator]:
Your scout, The Silent? 


[THE MONSTER]:
Stupid girl couldn't work a gun for shit...There is no doubt that she was only just a kid wanting something to prove. But tearing out her throat...you call that justice?


[Interrogator]:
The brains, The Restless? 


[THE MONSTER]:
Of course you give the neutral one a slap on the wrist compared to us...
One's awaiting punishment...
Another can't speak anymore...
I'm awaiting my punishment...
But he...exile?


[Interrogator]:
He has proven to be non threatening to us. 


[THE MONSTER]:
I hope he rots in whatever rat hole he crawled into... 


[Interrogator]:
We're getting side tracked. Did you or did you not wipe those races by yourself?


[THE MONSTER]:
...I did.
(they turn to the camera, watching them every waking second)
You hear that "Leader" Seax...I did it...all to prove your fake God false to the people. I MURDERED THOSE BILLIONS.
