(EXTENSIVE REPORT ON BOMBING)
At hour 15 in our capital city, Jyakano, an explosion happened at the tower resuraunt, The Bulb, the center of the shopping district.
167 deaths and counting.

The explosion was not set to cause destruction, but to release a toxic gas previously locked away inside of a 
bunker in the far north of Trauvia, krimm, into the atmosphere and the city's streets.

Krimm has been indentified to make the inhalant become allergic to our grain, while this is only a mild allergy, too much
exposure to the gas can cause seizures, strokes and death. In rare cases, the inhalant becomes deathly allergic to our grain.

Eye witnesses did not see anyone suspicious enter The Bulb. After the explosion however, one was seen running out looking the most affected.
One of the waitresses claimed that their voice became more raspy and violent sounding post-explosion.

This is our prime suspect so far, no one can possibly be THAT infected from krimm unless they were standing right next to it.
Our conclusion being that this is the individual who set off the bomb.
We suspect that the detonation was accidental, as a smart bomber would leave the goddamn blast radius before detonation.
The bomber probably dropped the bomb or did something stupid.

When we came to looking for prior offenders, we decided to pay a visit to [REDACTED]. Someone taking shelter at a motel just a few days after
we released her from temporary custody after being arrested for trespassing onto The Bulb after it closed. And wouldn't you know it, she was there along with
[REDACTED], a fellon previously charged with protestation, and [REDACTED], a former TMA secretary.

The very suspicious group of people were detained, and we waited to see if our prime suspect was connected to this group, so we waited patiently
in secrecy while we having fun duct tapping the other fucker's mouths and beating them.

Sure enough, the suspect walked in. And was detained instantly.
Took them down to the station and took their mugshots and started questioning instantly, from their testomonies, here is what these fuckers have
to offer.

FULL REPORT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NAME: [REDACTED] (The Traitor)
RACE: Trauvian, Mid-Atmospheric
INVOLVMENT: Founder of their so called group, "Proof Makers". He has a little history with us.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NAME: [REDACTED] (The Monster)
RACE: Trauvian, Southern-Atmospheric
INVOLVMENT: Grunt work and second in command for Proof Makers, they also choose the gas to be used in the bombing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NAME: [REDACTED] (The Silent)
RACE: Trauvian, Mid-Atmospheric
INVOLVMENT: Used her knowledge of Trauvia to scout and report areas for Proof Makers. (Explains the trespassing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NAME: [REDACTED] (The Restless)
RACE: Trauvian, Nothern-Atmospheric
INVOLVMENT: Used intel from his previous involvement at TMA to give info to Proof Makers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Proof Makers" is a group formed from the members stemming hatred for Seax, and most offensively, Deprai.

We've been unknowingly been dealing with this group for 2 years, they call their little movement
"The Uprising Of Galaxy 5". Funny how they came up with that AFTER we wiped out our fifth galaxy.

Each member has been charged with multiple crimes, such as:
- Conspiracy
- Protesting against the Trauvian Government
- Questioning Deprai and/or his motives
- Terrorism
- (And more specific charges scattered accross specific members.)

These fuckers are awaiting to be picked up by you, TMA. Get a trial rolling asap.
I think [REDACTED] should get her trial first, she has the least involvement.
Let Seax decide the punishment for each.
