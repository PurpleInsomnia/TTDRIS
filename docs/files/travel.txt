Today, our first launch of a test subject into another universe worked.
Vital signs of our test subject were found in our desired location.

The test subject died to their pre-existing fatal krimm poisoning.

From this we can gather that multi-universal jumps are 100% possible.
We hypothosize that out there, there exists a universe where we can get [REDACTED] without the help of The Monster.

This however, will sadly take DECADES. Possibly CENTURIES before we can find one. Producing energy for the portal's aren't cheap.
However, traveling to different dimensions, is cheap as you can get.

It might not be our place to say anything, but might we suggest sending a less dangerous member of UOG5 to an alternate universe and send
a more dangerous one to a different dimension? Who cares if we kill the fucking things in the process.

Anyways, this is still really good news. Let's not go too crazy with this, we don't want to accidentally make black holes or anything.
If threats arise when researching a different dimension, best to call you-know-who for the job.

Trauvian Science Dimensional Research Labs,

I'm absolutely in favor of sending UOG5 members to anywhere but this plane of existance.
I say we send The Traitor to another universe, and The Monster to another dimension.
Fuck the cost, these guys need to go.

SUBJECT: URGENT.

As you and the others watched this afternoon, the tranfers were a sucess. We dubbed the universe "U-TVO", and the dimension...we should have informed you on
this earlier, but we found one that seems to interconnect with every being in the universe. It's it's own universe inside of this one.
We told The Monster about this before we sent them off, and they looked...petrified.

They know something we don't, that alone scares...but facinates us more. A few years after we're certain The Monster is nowhere near the "drop-off" point, we
NEED to start researching.
Maybe this is where [REDACTED] comes from? Such power can't be trusted in any being's hands. And we must destroy it.

If The Monster is somehow still alive, please PLEASE keep you-know-who ready to react at a moment's notice. He's the only one who has ever made that thing
bleed.
